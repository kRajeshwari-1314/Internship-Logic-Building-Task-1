# Advanced Generative AI Internship – Task 1  
Innomatics Research Labs

This project represents my submission for Internship Task 1.

The assignment focuses on implementing core Python logic to solve real-world inspired problems related to authentication, academic evaluation, data preprocessing, message validation, and system log monitoring.

##  Key Implementations

- Login validation using conditional logic
- Student performance analysis using loops
- Text data cleaning using string methods
- Message length analysis and filtering
- Log monitoring through error detection

The solutions are implemented using fundamental Python programming constructs and structured for clarity and readability.
